# TitleUP

TitleUP is an AI powered tool for content creators.

Built in Node.js with Node Natural and displayed through react, TitleUP is a tool which uses Machine learning and Beysian classification to create intelligent suggestions on article titles, based on article data crawled and scrapped from Medium.com.

# Tools

TitleUP currently contains three primary tools:

# Tag Generator
Given the name of a new article title, TitleUP can suggest what hashtags(#) you should put on our article for optimal coverage.

# N-gram Suggestor
Given a genre, TitleUP will tell you the top phrases in the genere to help inspire the writer's next article. These can be wording such as "This is how" or topical phrases.

# Title Generator
This feature is still in Beta.

Given a genre, TitleUP can suggest a title for a new article, that has yet to be written.
This is based on patterns of parts of speech, which generated per genre, and statistically filled with words based on frequence and popularity of the word.

# Title Improver (coming soon)

Given a title and a genre, TitleUP can indentify the most important parts of your article title and will re-word it to give you a title which is optimized for reader interest.
